# How to collaborate secretly using R and public git-hub repository?

Tools preparation (Git, rcrypt package, gpg4win) is self-explonatory during installation. Usage is very simple:

- After PULL decrypt your files in R

- Before PUSH encrypt your files. For details check 'secure.txt'. 

Additionally scripts (.R files) and data (.csv files) are cloaked in .gitignore.

Everything can be 'seasoned' to your particular taste. 
But still for some 'dishes' private repository is the best place to cook.
